I'm doing this in awk because I like awk. I also like the look on
people's faces when they realize I'm serious about using awk.

Each subdirectory contains (at least):

- The Test Data for the day
- The Input Data for the day
- awk program for the first part of the puzzle
- awk program for the second part of the puzzle

I'm using the stock awk package on Mac OS X 10.15.7 which
can be found at https://opensource.apple.com/source/awk/awk-24.140.1/

I tend to prefer GNU awk, but when in Rome...

I either use vi or Visual Studio Code. A coin flip is usually
involved in the decision making process concerning editors.

Finally, the day0 directory has some books and URLs on awk. You should read
them.  awk builds bodies in twelve strong ways.

Cheers,
Fuzz
