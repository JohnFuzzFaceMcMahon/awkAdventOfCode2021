I managed to get Part 1 finished pretty easily. The code changes for Part 2 were very simple. The problem is that the
data is growing by leaps and bounds! I'm currently running the Part 2 program on the test data. Step 20 (now complete)
took around 3900 seconds (65 minutes). Step 21 took 21742 seconds (6 hours). Now 10% through Step 22 and the program is 
cranking at a whopping??!? 109 pair checks per second. I have a long wait to verify the test, and a longer wait to run
the real data! 

Pushing day14part2.awk to GitHub, but it isn't fully tested obviously...

Stats as of 1PM US/Eastern on 2021-12-14. Day 12 is noticable in its absence.
